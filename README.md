Tech Choicess:  

  
# React
Pros:

1 - Virtual Dom: Is a cheaper and faster way to update the JavaScript DOM. Virtual Dom makes a coppy of the DOM and then checks if there has been any changes made, if so it updates just the part of the DOM that changed.

2 - Reusability: Usually React takes a long time to initially set up, but once you are up and running it all comes to place. It is easier to manage updates. The reason is that all the components of the system are completely isolated. As a result of this, changes initiated in any of the components will not affect the others. It makes it possible to reuse components that didn’t produce changes, and this makes programming more comfortable and precise for online business owners. 

3 - One - Way data flow: Code stability is greatly achievable with the ReactJS. It allows programmers to work directly with the components and also make use of the data-binding technique to make sure changes that what took place in child structures doesn’t affect the parents.

Cons: 

1 - Node is full of bad dependencies: It is usually pretty had to find a good dependency with constant suppoert and updates.

Dependency list: 

1 - Eslint: Eslint is great to add few rules to your code formatting  
2 - Firebase: Used firebase, because of it build in log in and real time database features. Even tho i couldnt finish the database part in time the security and implementation of the firebase features are great.  
3 - MaterialUI: Great UX design library, i prefer MaterialU, because of its clear examples and easy to override CSS and Themes.  
4 - React-Stars: To be fair my plan was to build the start by myself, but when i checked in google this repository has over 4000 weekly downloads and it took me less time to implement it.  


### If i had a little more time: 

1 - Redux: Redux is the greatest tool created for React. It allows you to have all the components state in one place, the issue is that Redux usually takes a long time to set up and in this time window i decided to go without. Most of the bugs i encountered could have been avoided if i had Redux on my side.  

2 - Real time database comments: My initiall plan was to have the comments in the firebase realtime database, so everyone could see your comments. Due to few bumps here and there didn't have time for it.
