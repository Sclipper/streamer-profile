Dependency list: 

1 - Eslint: Eslint is great to add few rules to your code formatting
2 - Firebase: Used firebase, because of it build in log in and real time database features. Even tho i couldnt finish the database part in time the security and implementation of the firebase features are great.
3 - MaterialUI: Great UX design library, i prefer MaterialU, because of its clear examples and easy to override CSS and Themes.
4 - React-Stars: To be fair my plan was to build the start by myself, but when i checked in google this repository has over 4 000 weekly downloads and it took me less time to implement it.
